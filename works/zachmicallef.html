        <br><br> 
        'Silver Halideâ€™ draws from a reading of colonisation as an act of forcefully overwriting existing systems of culture. Existing systems of knowledge, community, belief, and justice, have been entirely disregarded in lieu of alternatives from western culture. Western culture has a tendency toward ethnocentric points of view, focusing on humans above all; reducing land to a financial asset and commodity. 
        <br><br>The work also acts as a critique of the falsely assumed indexical quality of photography, arguing its representation - particularly of landscape - cannot fully envelop the deeply complex histories and actions which inform people and place. It posits that photography can be understood as simply a blank medium being exposed to external elements, and through physically placing an object within a landscape, the indexical aggregate of elements that accumulate on the surface of this object represent place no less accurately than a traditional photograph. 
        <br><br>The body of work gives agency to the land in its own representation, selecting through natural process what is visually imprinted, and what is not.
