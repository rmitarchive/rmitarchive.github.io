            The Man Who Drowned Himself (2022)

        <br><br> 
        Drawing inspirations from the Greek tale of Narcissus, 'the Man who drowned himself' sets out as a retelling of narratives from both the historical and mythological for the exploration of ego and leadership. 
        <br><br>Compositing from portraits of military leaders and royalty and graphics of war and death, my goal was to create a fictional character to become the embodiment of ego and narcissism and tell a story about their drowning just like Narcissus infatuated with their own image.
