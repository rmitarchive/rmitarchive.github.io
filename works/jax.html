        A Polluted World is a montage of various pollution phenomena in the city. It includes water pollution, air pollution, plastic pollution and other environmental pollution. The work combines pollution with real life to show the harm of environmental pollution to the earth. In the works, the distinctive characteristics of environmental pollution are shown through the method of magic realism to achieve an exaggerated effect. 
        <br><br>The main purpose of "A Polluted World" is to show the contradiction between today's social development and the environment and to call on people to protect the environment and move towards sustainable development.
