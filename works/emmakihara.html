        “Yoshifusa” follows my grandfather's journey with his battle with Alzheimer's Disease.  The series of montages shows his deterioration of memory and the ability to recognise family members and location through the blurring of faces and location as each photomontage goes by. 
        <br><br>This series focuses on the effect of Alzheimers by showing how as the years go along it becomes difficult for those to remember as the brain shrinks. I showcase this by making each montage smaller and smaller noting how the brain shrinks from the effects of Alzheimers. The text on each print shows some common phrases he asks family members on a daily basis in Japanese.
        <br><br>My body of work presents the daily struggle Alzheimers can cause from my grandfather's perspective as well as from the perspective of family members.
