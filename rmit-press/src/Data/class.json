The many people I met and the many places I went. Not only would this piece of design be a memoir to myself, but if composed beautifully enough, be a piece of consumable media for the individual who is naturally artistically inclined and presents an interest in indulging in my artwork composed in a digestible publication. It’s also a project; once manufactured; could go on to become commercially stocked in bookstores. It’s my dream to produce a hardcover book to the high standard of those stocked at Readings or Metropolis.",
        "bio":"Japan, from my many experiences, provides a main takeaway of sensory overload in the form of sound and vision and colour. It is a even of art and design and music appreciation. This is a main point of reflection I want embodied in my potential publication.\n\nI originally intended on this ethereal experience to be documented in illustrative form. I have the reference document of over 1000 photos I shot on a small digital handheld camera, however I am not a photographer and these are not necessarily skilfully captured photos. However, the subject matter what the people/places/things are the vital takeaway from these photos. In order to create a capstone project that challenges me to create my best body of design skill and work yet, I agreed with myself that these photos would best if used as a reference point for illustration, which I would consider my strong point in design. Upon drawing this developmental conclusion, a new question arises; what medium? What style? Cartoon, realistic? Oil, pencil, digital? After some extended mental debate, an initial lead on oil arose; which drew to an end after how long it took to make just one. Finally, a realistic update was drawn; that my pictures would be drawn realistically in pencil, scanned, and coloured on Photoshop. Not only will this method of action cut the time in half, it will allow me to make more. Quantity is a key point when creating a coffee-table style book (it’s gotta have a little chunk in that spine!). Colouring on photoshop will also allow me to really exponentially play with colours and patterns (an important point in accurately depicting Japan in my opinion).",

        "bio":"I'm Beverly, and I love to create all things colourful. As a designer, my comfort zone would be over-using sans-serif fonts, and pastel colours. I didn't expect I would love design as much as I do now when I started my first year at RMIT, but now I can say it's all I ever wanted to do. I enjoy doing branding, publication and as showcased in the grad show, I found out I also love doing illustrations. My creative practice mostly involves just me trying my best to push myself out of my comfort zone, but we all know how hard this is. I hate feeling like I wasn't doing well enough, or feeling disatisfied with my own designs. However, I overcame this by continously expanding my knowledge on design practices I'm not familiar of. Turns out, learning new skills and stepping out of my comfort zone is what made me grew as a designer. \n\nHaving the opportunity to do this capstone was something I always looked for as a designer. Creating something for the first time ever, and showcasing it on the grad show is definately nerve-wrecking, but I am proud of my work and how far I have come as a designer. After three years at RMIT, I can say that I am graduating with so many amazing experiences I never thought I'd get. Not only as a student, but I have found my passion as a person. RMIT really gave me the opportunity to take my time and figure out what kind of designer I am, the things I enjoy and the things I would rather keep in my folders. After this, I intend  to keep the student mentality inside of me as I hope to keep growing. ",

It seeks to shed light on the various ways in which women in the East are bound by societal expectations, cultural norms, and gender roles, while also celebrating their capacity to break free and redefine their identities.\n\nEach page of the book serves as a window into the multifaceted experiences of Eastern women, capturing their struggles, dreams, and triumphs. The content examines the oppression and limitations imposed on women's thoughts and behaviors, such as conforming to traditional gender roles, facing dress codes and beauty standards, staying silent versus using their voices, and grappling with the complexities of relationships and family expectations.\n\nThis project aims to inspire and empower women by highlighting their resilience, strength, and ability to overcome adversity. It encourages women to embrace their unique identities, challenge societal norms, and pave the way for a more inclusive and equitable future. By presenting contrasting representations of 'bound' and 'free,' the book creates a visual and emotional journey that ignites a sense of liberation and motivates readers to question, reflect, and take action.\n\nThe book invites viewers to immerse themselves in the rich tapestry of Eastern women's experiences, fostering empathy, understanding, and solidarity. Through this artistic medium, it is hoped that the project will contribute to a wider movement of empowerment and social change, encouraging individuals to question the status quo and actively participate in the ongoing journey towards equality and freedom.",

        "desc":"This work is an exploration between the division of human and machine. It is an assertion of humanity, searching for community and refuge from technological suffocation.\n\nThe role of language.\n\nA driving point of tension, and a fundamental difference, between the person and the machine is the function and interpretation of language. Language to a machine is a transaction of data. A plastic articulation of commands, focused on limitless optimisation, devoid of context, empathy and lived experience.\n\nLanguage for a human being is essential and takes many forms. It exists as letters, numbers, words and images but also as gestures, tradition, sound, movement, touch.\n\nThrough language we reify the irrepressible and fundamental fact that I am real, you are real and that we acknowledge and cherish our shared impact on each other.\n\nIt is how we express joy and grief. It is how we console and how we connect.\n\nIt is how we find reason to be, and how we celebrate it.\n\nIt is a connective tether between our understanding of now, what has been and what will come.\n\nIn searching for an expression of connection through the interpretation of language, there also exists a point of finding where language no longer serves machine but persists for us. One of the most universal languages observed in all places, always, is that of food. Regardless of our ability to communicate verbally or through written word, we are able to communicate our affection and our care through the sharing of a meal. It is a biological need that brings us together and one that serves no authentic purpose to a machine.\n\nThis work is intended to exist as a technologically impenetrable object.\n\nIt is for people, and people alone.\n\nIt represents a celebration of humanity, presented in the symbolic syntax of the captcha anti-bot detection system - a presentation of language that is unreadable to the machine but understood by the human eye.\n\nWhat is presented is a metaphoric ‘cook-book’, translated to the form of a tablecloth. The text housed on the surface of the textile is a transposition of a meal, consisting of:\n\nAn entrée of bread\n\nA main course of egg & bacon quiche\n\nA desert of chocolate & cinnamon sponge cake.\n\nThese recipes and their instructions were originally devised by my dear Nana, who passed several years ago. These recipes and their instructions are from hand-written cookbooks she left behind. Written records of love, translated through food, left for her children and their children.\n\nEach ingredient choice, each articulated instruction – every pen stroke - is charged with an irrepressible devotion. It is informed with tender intention for the act to be repeated and reexperienced by anyone that comes across it, so that they too can share that meal with not just those at the table, but with her and her family. It is an invitation to share time and space, in the same way that a film is an invitation to experience a story together, or that a book is an invitation to mutually explore.\n\nWhat I’ve attempted to create is an object that serves no purpose to and cannot be mechanically interpreted by the machine but is an articulation of and an invitation to experience shared humanity and community.\n\nIts form as a tablecloth, while pragmatically obtuse in it’s purpose as an instructional document, is intended to communicate and embody the ideological underpinnings of its function.\n\nIt is laid over the table at which the meal is eaten, serving as both temporal and gestural signifier of this tender communion between those participating in the meal",

Acting as a strong expression of self, I intend to express my own individualism by vocalizing my experiences.\n\nHigh-school is a challenging experience almost everyone goes through. While attending an all-girls school, I found it to be a toxic and stressful environment which led to a lack of self-expression and a struggle with identity. This diary was used throughout my teen years in an effort to channel my suppressed feelings and emotions, reporting on the current happenings, drama and venting about life.\n\nThe use of cartoon-like illustrations throughout the publication is to make the audience think for a moment about how the quote translates into the imagery. I used metaphors and wordplay to create clever designs which both captivate and intrigue the audience about the story behind it.\n\nIn the title, ‘Slice’, I aim to give meaning to the phrase ‘slice of my life’, as the zine is about the time I attended high- school, which in reality, is a small part of my existence.\n\nThe cake slice illustration is another play on words, foreshadowing the satirical nature of the zine.\n\nThe back cover acknowledges Country as the place in which I published the Zine, and the relational mentality I make an effort to keep while producing or researching in Naarm. The ending sentence is a hidden reference from my diary, where I would finish each entry with “Until next time <3”, indicating that there may be another zine produced.\n\nBound by a threaded saddle-stitch, the zine is A5 in size and 16 pages long. The size and length of the publication is in-line with the ‘short and sweet’ nature of zines, since it is intended to be small-circulated and self-published.

Through it, I've learned not only the mechanics of merging traditional motifs with modern design techniques but also the depth and richness of my own cultural heritage.

I thought about the unique scar that I have had since childhood, which is like the “cause” that has shaped who I am today. Because of this, I  have developed a great interest in cause and effect and have decided to research this topic.\n\nThe brand ‘cic’ is aiming to recycle unwanted possessions and share their fascinating backstories to the buyer. The content of the design is primarily expressed through the alternating use of five different colours and circular shapes combined to create visual effects to achieve the goal of attracting buyers.\n\nMy scars add a unique look and tell a story about my Journey. In vintage culture, I strive for a distinctive fashion style and a personal image that sets me apart from the mainstream trends. I view my scars as marks on my body, giving me a distinct physical feature that resonates with the unique aesthetic of vintage culture.\n\nVintage culture fascinates me with its interest in past eras and historical narratives. My scars, as physical traces on my body, carry my personal history and stories. Embracing the concept of causal loops, I believe time is cyclic, intertwining the past, present and future. My scars represent markers of my past experiences, making them an integral part of my personal history and stories, aligning with vintage culture’s focus on history and exploration."

        "bio":"My artwork stems from two simple desires. First, separation has always been a heavy topic for humans. Not every pet owner can immediately accept the reality of their pet's passing. Therefore, I aim to help those who are grieving the loss of a beloved pet. Second, with the concept of the Land of Eternity, I offer an emotional buffer. Providing a proper farewell to their pets makes their journey in this life worthwhile.\n\nDuring my childhood, conflicts at home burdened me with constant anxiety, making me dread returning home. However, everything changed when I welcomed a small dog into my life. The unconditional love and daily anticipation of their warm welcome after school brought me solace. Yet, as time passed, like any ordinary adult, my dog was said to have transcended to heaven. Curiosity sparked within me about the nature of heaven and whether it could have a tangible existence. This curiosity became the foundation for my artistic expression.",

While religion is often seen as emotional and superstitious, and science as calm and objective, there is a dialectical cognition of things in religion that conforms to the spirit of science. Conversely, those who believe that science is the only means of understanding the world are embracing the spirit of religion.\n\nThe project presents the scientific symbol system in religious visual form and presents religious concepts with scientific infographic forms, revealing the complex intertwinement of science and religion. By creating something scientific yet imbued with religious and metaphysical connotations, the project aims to encourage the audience to think about the combination of science and religion and to challenge their dualistic view of the two.",
