        "bio":"I'm Beverly, and I love to create all things colourful. As a designer, my comfort zone would be over-using sans-serif fonts, and pastel colours. I didn't expect I would love design as much as I do now when I started my first year at RMIT, but now I can say it's all I ever wanted to do. I enjoy doing branding, publication and as showcased in the grad show, I found out I also love doing illustrations. My creative practice mostly involves just me trying my best to push myself out of my comfort zone, but we all know how hard this is. I hate feeling like I wasn't doing well enough, or feeling disatisfied with my own designs. However, I overcame this by continously expanding my knowledge on design practices I'm not familiar of. Turns out, learning new skills and stepping out of my comfort zone is what made me grew as a designer. \n\nHaving the opportunity to do this capstone was something I always looked for as a designer. Creating something for the first time ever, and showcasing it on the grad show is definately nerve-wrecking, but I am proud of my work and how far I have come as a designer. After three years at RMIT, I can say that I am graduating with so many amazing experiences I never thought I'd get. Not only as a student, but I have found my passion as a person. RMIT really gave me the opportunity to take my time and figure out what kind of designer I am, the things I enjoy and the things I would rather keep in my folders. After this, I intend  to keep the student mentality inside of me as I hope to keep growing. ",

        "desc": "The aim of this project is to develop an exhibition or event proposal for our chosen cultural organisation. I developed an exhibition proposal for the Australian art gallery NGV (National Gallery of Victoria).\n\n“Being Human” is an art and design exhibition that explores the multifaceted meaning of what it means to be human. By presenting an array of art and design works, it invites the audience to pause and reflect on their past and present choices, experiences, needs, and wants, and think about how they would like to proceed and possibly live differently in the future as an individual, as well as collectively. For those who feel lost and are unsure about what they want in life, the artworks and designs in this exhibition provide some starting points for them to consider. Ultimately, the exhibition aims to empower the audience to be brave and live the life they want.\n\nThe exhibition proposal features a toolbox of visual elements such as color scheme, typography, logo, and hero images that can be combined and applied to a broad range of promotional materials. It also includes a basic plan and visualisation of the visitor’s experience in the exhibition.",

My work is a constant search for how to create a unique, impactful, and memorable experience for the audience. My passion as a designer lies in exploring the intersection of publication design, packaging design, 3D design, and architectural design. ",

While religion is often seen as emotional and superstitious, and science as calm and objective, there is a dialectical cognition of things in religion that conforms to the spirit of science. Conversely, those who believe that science is the only means of understanding the world are embracing the spirit of religion.\n\nThe project presents the scientific symbol system in religious visual form and presents religious concepts with scientific infographic forms, revealing the complex intertwinement of science and religion. By creating something scientific yet imbued with religious and metaphysical connotations, the project aims to encourage the audience to think about the combination of science and religion and to challenge their dualistic view of the two.",
