The many people I met and the many places I went. Not only would this piece of design be a memoir to myself, but if composed beautifully enough, be a piece of consumable media for the individual who is naturally artistically inclined and presents an interest in indulging in my artwork composed in a digestible publication. It’s also a project; once manufactured; could go on to become commercially stocked in bookstores. It’s my dream to produce a hardcover book to the high standard of those stocked at Readings or Metropolis.",

        "desc": "Through this series To Build A Home, artist and designer Finn Stewart manifests the potential of post-consumer material– fashioning functionalist forms imbued with idiosyncratic readings. Through his gestures of upcycling, he finds a vernacular of contradiction which oscillates between rational non-functionalism and irrational functionalism. Finn humorously references canonical designs of the minimalist art period. As in the case of “Donald Crudd”, he borrows Judd’s simplistic model, juxtaposing it with reclaimed material and ultimately puts the modernist form on trial. Through his intuitive process of selection and assemblage, Finn leaves human impressions on that which is typically mass produced. The comfort and value found in these flawed objects brings home the precarious and catalytic nature of this artist’s lifestyle. They are his artifacts of lived experience, caught between crosswinds of desire and austerity.",

Our dreams are personal, but are they unique? Can I describe a syntax or language that is shared, recognisable and self evident?",

While religion is often seen as emotional and superstitious, and science as calm and objective, there is a dialectical cognition of things in religion that conforms to the spirit of science. Conversely, those who believe that science is the only means of understanding the world are embracing the spirit of religion. The project presents the scientific symbol system in religious visual form and presents religious concepts with scientific infographic forms, revealing the complex intertwinement of science and religion. By creating something scientific yet imbued with religious and metaphysical connotations, the project aims to encourage the audience to think about the combination of science and religion and to challenge their dualistic view of the two.",
